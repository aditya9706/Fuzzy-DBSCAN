# Fuzzy-DBSCAN
Modifiying DBSCAN clustering algorithm with addition of fuzziness
The project contains the modified program of DBSCAN in python. The Algorithm helps in forming better clusters than DBSCAN as it adds Fuzziness to the points so that they can represent more than one cluster with different Membership.
The Fuzzy_DBSCAN_1 contains algorithm of a Research Paper.
The Fuzzy_DBSCAN_2 contains algorithm which adds fuzziness to the points depending on a new function.
Testing the better between the two Algorithm is still in Progress.
